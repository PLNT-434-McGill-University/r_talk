## Outline

::: {.incremental}

- What is R and RStudio

- R packages

- Rmarkdown and Quarto

- tidyverse and ggplot
:::

## Exercise - `babynames`

- This package contains three datasets provided by the USA social security administration

- `babynames`: For each year from 1880 to 2017, the number of children of each sex given each name. All names with more than 5 uses are given.


## R and RStudio



:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="25%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/r-logo.png")
```

- R is an open-source statistical **programming language**
- R is also an environment for statistical computing and graphics
- It's easily extensible with *packages*

::: {.column width="45%"}

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio-logo.png")
```

- RStudio is a convenient interface for R called an **IDE** (integrated development environment), e.g. *"I write R code in the RStudio IDE"*
- RStudio is not a requirement for programming with R, but it's very commonly used by R programmers and data scientists

## R packages

::: {.incremental}

- **Packages** are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data^[Wickham and Bryan, [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/)]

- As of September 2020, there are over 16,000 R packages available on **CRAN** (the Comprehensive R Archive Network)^[[CRAN contributed packages](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/)]

- We're going to work with a small (but important) subset of these!

## Tour: R and RStudio

[![](img/tour-r-rstudio.png){fig-align="center" width=900px fig-alt="R and RStudio tour"}]()


## A short list (for now) of R essentials

- Functions are (most often) verbs, followed by what they will be applied to in parentheses:

```python
do_this(to_this)
do_that(to_this, to_that, with_those)
```

- Packages are installed with the `install.packages` function and loaded with the `library` function, once per session:

```python
install.packages("package_name")
library(package_name)
```


## R essentials (continued)

- Columns (variables) in data frames are accessed with `$`:


```python
dataframe$var_name
```




- Object documentation can be accessed with `?`

```python
?mean
```


## tidyverse

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="99%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/tidyverse.png")
```
:::

::: {.column width="10%"}
<!-- empty column to create gap -->
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}

[tidyverse.org](https://www.tidyverse.org/)


- The **tidyverse** is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science
- All packages share an underlying philosophy and a common grammar

# R Markdown and Quarto

## R Markdown and Quarto

::: {.incremental}

- Fully reproducible reports -- each time you render/knit the analysis is ran from the beginning

- Simple markdown syntax for text

- Code goes in chunks, defined by three backticks, narrative goes outside of chunks

## Rmarkdown

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}

[rmarkdown.rstudio.com](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)


- **Rmarkdown** and the various packages that support it enable R users to write their code and prose in reproducible computational documents

## ggplot2

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}

- **ggplot2** is tidyverse's data visualization package

- **gg** in `ggplot2` stands for Grammar of Graphics

- Inspired by the book Grammar of Graphics by Leland Wilkinson

## Grammar of Graphics

A grammar of graphics is a tool that enables us to concisely describe the components of a graphic


[![](img/grammar-of-graphics.png){fig-align="right" width=400px fig-alt="ggplot logo"}]()

## Mass vs. height


```{r}
#| echo: true
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Mass vs. height of Starwars characters",
       x = "Height (cm)", y = "Weight (kg)")
```

## Mass vs. height

- What are the functions doing the plotting?
- What is the dataset being plotted?
- Which variables map to which features (aesthetics) of the plot?
- What does the warning mean?

```{r}
#| message: false
#| echo: true
#| fig-show: hide
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Mass vs. height of Starwars characters",
       x = "Height (cm)", y = "Weight (kg)")
```

## ggplot2

- `ggplot()` is the main function in ggplot2
- Plots are constructed in layers
- Structure of the code for plots can be summarized as


```python
ggplot(data = [dataset], 
       mapping = aes(x = [x-variable], y = [y-variable])) +
   geom_xxx() +
   other options
```

## Data: Palmer Penguins

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}

- Measurements for penguin species, island in Palmer Archipelago, size (flipper length, body mass, bill dimensions), and sex.

ggplot(data = penguins, 
       mapping = aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm,
                     colour = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Bill depth and length",
       subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins",
       x = "Bill depth (mm)", y = "Bill length (mm)",
       colour = "Species")
```
